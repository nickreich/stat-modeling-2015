\frametitle{Regression so far ...}
    
At this point we have covered:

{\small
\begin{itemize}
\item Simple linear regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Relationship between numerical response and a numerical or categorical predictor
\end{itemize}
\item Multiple regression
\begin{itemize}
\item Relationship between numerical response and multiple numerical and/or categorical predictors
\item What to do when the relationships with the predictors are complex (nonlinear, skewed distribution, interactions, confounding, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}


What we haven't covered is what to do when the response is not continuous (i.e. categorical, count data, etc.)

\frametitle{Example - Birdkeeping and Lung Cancer}

A 1972 - 1981 health survey in The Hague, Netherlands, discovered an association between keeping pet birds and increased risk of lung cancer. To investigate birdkeeping as a risk factor, researchers conducted a case-control study of patients in 1985 at four hospitals in The Hague (population 450,000). They identified 49 cases of lung cancer among the patients who were registered with a general practice, who were age 65 or younger and who had resided in the city since 1965. They also selected 98 controls from a population of residents having the same general age structure.

\frametitle{Generalized linear models: defined}

All generalized linear models have the following three characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf A probability distribution} describing the outcome variable \\
\bi
\item e.g. $Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p) \longrightarrow \mathbb E[Y|p] = p$. 
\ei
\item {\bf A linear model}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\eta = \beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_p X_p$
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf A link function} that relates the linear model to the parameter of the outcome distribution
\begin{itemize}
\item $g(\mathbb E[Y]) = g(p) = \eta$ or $\mathbb E[Y] = p = g^{-1}(\eta)$
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Odds}

\vspace{-2mm}

Odds are another way of quantifying the probability of an event, commonly used in gambling (and logistic regression).\\

~\\

{
For some event $E$,
{\small
\[\text{odds}(E) = \frac{P(E)}{P(E^c)} = \frac{P(E)}{1-P(E)}\]
}
Similarly, if we are told the odds of E are $x$ to $y$ then
{\small
\[\text{odds}(E) = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{x/(x+y)}{y/(x+y)} \]
}
which implies
{\small
\[P(E) = x/(x+y),\quad P(E^c) = y/(x+y)\]
}
}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Logistic regression has log(odds) as the link}

A logistic regression model can be defined as follows:

$$Y_i | \mathbf x_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$$
$$\mathbb E[Y_i|\mathbf x_i] = Pr(Y_i=1|\mathbf x_i) = p_i$$
$$g(p_i) = logit (p_i) = \log \frac{p_i}{1-p_i} $$
$$logit(\mathbb E[Y_i|\mathbf x_i]) = logit (p_i)  = \eta =  \beta_0+\beta_1 X_{i1} + \cdots + \beta_p X_{ip}$$

Keeping all other predictors constant then,
\begin{itemize}

\item The odds ratio of getting lung cancer for bird keepers vs non-bird keepers is $\exp(1.3626) = 3.91$.

\item The odds ratio of getting lung cancer for an additional year of smoking is $\exp(0.0729) = 1.08$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What do the numbers not mean ...}

The most common mistake made when interpreting logistic regression is to treat an odds ratio as a ratio of probabilities.\\

~\\ 

Bird keepers are \emph{not} 4x more likely to develop lung cancer than non-bird keepers.

~\\ 

This is the difference between relative risk and an odds ratio.


\[RR = \frac{P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed})}{P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})} \]

\[OR = \frac{P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed}) / [1-P(\text{disease} | \text{exposed})]}{P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})/[1-P(\text{disease} | \text{unexposed})]} \]

    \myitem Accounts for the fact that you have ''adjusted" for some variables in the design.
    \myitem Calculates an OR for each matched-set/pair, then ''averages" across sets
    \myitem Forfeits ability to estimate effects of matched variables, but design can substantially improve power.
