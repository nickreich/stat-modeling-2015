\begin{frame}{Refresher: statistical power}

\begin{block}{Definition of statistical power}

\bi
    \myitem The ability of a method/test to detect an effect, conditional on that effect actually existing.
    \myitem The probability that our test rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is not true.
    \myitem Or, ``finding a signal that is really there''

\begin{frame}{``Post-hoc'' power calculations are controversial}

It is {\em always} preferable to calculate power prior to running your analysis. Better not to justify negative findings with a post-hoc power calculation!

\begin{frame}{Formula-based power calculation}

\begin{block}{Many simple tests have formulas for power, these ...}
\bi
    \myitem are easy to use
    \myitem may require you to estimate parameters from existing data (or make up justifiable numbers to plug in)
    \myitem are often appropriate for simple tests
    \myitem assume all standard assumptions are met
    \myitem are only available for simple/standard tests

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Simulation-based power calculation}

Calculating power via simulation is a tradeoff: computational complexity for customization and flexibility.

\begin{block}{Power simulations...}
\bi
    \myitem are available for any setting where you can simulate data (not limited to simple scenarios)
    \myitem can be used to preserve complex correlation sturctures in predictors (resample your $X$'s)
    \myitem are not assumption- or parameter-free
    \myitem often require more complicated coding 
    \myitem may be computationally intensive (i.e. need a long time to run)

\begin{block}{Option 2: resample predictors from a {\em training} dataset, simulate outcome}
\bi
    \myitem preserves structure of real predictor data
    \myitem requires a large dataset similar to the one you will be analyzing

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Power by resampling: example}

\footnotesize You plan to do a follow-up study to the one that generated our {\tt lung} dataset. You want to replicate the results that show a significant impact of smoking on the severity of disease. You don't have a lot of money to conduct the study, so you want to enroll as few participants as possible.

So we can say that if we were to repeat this study (in a similar population) with a sample size of \Sexpr{nobs}, our study would have \Sexpr{round(pwr, 2)} to detect a true relationship between smoking and disease severity.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Power by simulation: wrap-up}

\bi
\myitem Power analyses can be a really useful tool to explore the likelihood of your data analysis producing valuable results. 

\myitem Simulating power can be valuable in settings where there is no simple formula for calculating power.

\myitem It is also a good exercise to try to simulate your data -- you learn a lot about the structure of your data in the process!
